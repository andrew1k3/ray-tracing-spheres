# Ray Tracing 3D Visualizer

A simple ray tracing algorithm that renders a 3D world with spheres and lighting.

## Description
This program uses a basic ray tracing algorithm, demonstrating how light rays interact with a 3D environment containing spheres. The algorithm computes pixel colors based on ray-sphere intersections, resulting in a rendered image.
